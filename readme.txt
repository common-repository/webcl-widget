WebCL Widget shows if WebCL is working and if so, which OpenCL devices are available.

== Description ==

The WebCL project exposes OpenCL into JavaScript, allowing web developers to tap into the massive parallel computing resources of modern GPUs, multicore CPUs, and upcoming manycore accelerators. This, when combined with WebGL and other emerging standards such as asm.js, enables entirely new categories of interactive web apps, such as photo editing, video processing, visualization, simulation, and cutting-edge games -- things that haven't been possible on the web before.

This widget tells if there is support for WebCL available.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `webcl-widget` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or add the widget via the plugin-search.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Now you can place the widget.
